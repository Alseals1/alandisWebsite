I created a static site hosted on S3, secured with SSL certificates, and tracked visitors with a serverless backend using Lambda and DynamoDB. To automate deployments, I implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Terraform, ensuring efficient infrastructure management. This project sharpened my DevOps skills, from automation and monitoring with CloudWatch to building end-to-end cloud solutions.",
